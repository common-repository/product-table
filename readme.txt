== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the WooCommerce product table? =

Once the plugin is installed an activated click the Product Table menu from your WordPress dashboard, the page shows the shortcode to use and a full list of all the configuration options available including examples.

= Does it work on mobile/tablet? =

Yes, the product table is responsive, if the table content is too wide for the device's width then a horizontal scroll bar is used to allow the user to scroll right through the content.

= When using add to cart on the product table the mini cart doesn't get updated with the item =

Our plugin will update your mini cart if your theme uses the same mini cart coding standards as WooCommerce does. This works flawlessly with WooCommerce's official Storefront theme. Most theme developers use this standard and therefore you shouldn't have any issues. If you do it's likely your theme has a non-standard means of updating the mini cart contents via AJAX and therefore you'll need to discuss this with your theme developer to make the theme compatible with WooCommerce's standard mini cart functionality.
